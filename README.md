This is a redux tool kit project that helps one get the knowledge needed to start off;
The whole idea resonates on manipulting the items in a cart...
One can remove item form the cart;
One can add the cart items and while at it the cart count on the navbar changes;
One can also clear the whole cart where they get a prompt to either cancel the opearion or proceed;

When you clone the project, open it with vs code and on the terminal just type npm install and after that run npm start to see the whole process
